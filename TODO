Add checks to position.logp to ensure the mask is really in range, e.g. Pacific view issue 2012-02-15
 - maybe lookup functions should store metadata on the mask itself so they can be checked 

position.logp returns NA for fixed.release/recapture = NULL (fix with na.approx rule = 2)

add makelookup functions to have just a bounding box
