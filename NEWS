	o Fixed a bug in reynolds, it needs some stray integers stripped out
	(old Fortran something) - comments in the code show how to
	replicate the test output from the site.  o Added capability
	for gzipped files to reynolds, as well as "data" option to
	return sst, ice, err, land or water.

	o Added k0 attenuation offset to find.init - seems to perform
	better.

	o Fixed a bug! in mkTempMask - it was using only the
	initialized Reynolds dataset.


Changes to Version 0.0-2
o Recreated package completely

Changes to version 0.0-1
o Created package with all latest code
